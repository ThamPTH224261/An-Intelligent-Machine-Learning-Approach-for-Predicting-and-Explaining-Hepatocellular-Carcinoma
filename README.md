Dataset file and notebooks for loading and visualizing the data.

2. Feature Analysis & Selection

Evaluation of feature importance and feature selection.

Exploration of feature distributions.

3. Model Training & Optimization

Model training pipelines.

Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search.

Algorithm performance comparison.

4. Model Testing & Evaluation

Test-set evaluation.

Performance metrics and confusion matrices.

5. Explainability

LIME and SHAP notebooks for model interpretability.

Dataset

Merged_HCC.xlsx — the primary dataset used for all analyses.

Workflow Summary
