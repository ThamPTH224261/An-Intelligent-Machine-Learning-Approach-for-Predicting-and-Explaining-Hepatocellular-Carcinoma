# An-Intelligent-Machine-Learning-Approach-for-Predicting-and-Explaining-Hepatocellular-Carcinoma
This repository contains the entire workflow for processing the merged HCC dataset, including data preparation, feature selection, model training, and model explainability.
Overview

Data
Dataset and notebooks for data loading and visualization.

Feature Analysis & Selection
Exploration of feature distributions, feature importance, and feature selection.

Model Training & Optimization
Model training, hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search), and algorithm comparison.

Model Testing & Evaluation
Evaluation on the test set, performance metrics, and confusion matrices.

Explainability
LIME and SHAP notebooks for model interpretability.

Includes a single dataset file (Merged_HCC.xlsx).
Workflow: raw data → analysis → modeling → evaluation → interpretability.
